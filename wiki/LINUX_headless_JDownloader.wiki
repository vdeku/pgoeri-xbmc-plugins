#summary HowTo install jdownloader without an xserver

= Introduction =

At the moment there is no headless mode available for the jdownloader application. However by using an virtual xserver it is no problem to start jdownloader in the background.


= Details =

First of all install *tightvncserver*, then make sure that the vncserver starts automatically on startup by creating */etc/init.d/vncserver*:

The last step is to start jdownloader on vncserver startup, by creating the file *~/etc/xstartup*

{{{
#!/bin/sh

/etc/X11/Xsession &

sleep 100

sudo -u <user> <jdownloader-directory>/jd.sh &
}}}

You will also have to modify jd.sh to your needs. (Mainly enter the jd directory)
